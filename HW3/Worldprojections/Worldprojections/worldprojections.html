    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS:</h2>
    <p>I displayed the maps in different projections by searching for the projection number in the Projection Coordinate Reference System in QGIS. Then, I ran Indicatrix on that projection to develop the distortion circles and the longitude/latitude lines. From there, I tried out different projections and made new print layouts with each projection.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Shape: preserved for the most part, especially along the equator, flattened closer to the poles.
        <p></p>
        Area: preserved along the equator and the prime meridian, area increases as we get closer to the poles.
        <p></p>
        Distance: I think distance is preserved, but not sure.
        <p></p> 
        Direction: distorted? possibly because it is a rectangle. </h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Shape: preserved along the equator and the prime meridian, distorted towards the poles
        <p></p>
        Area: preserved for the most part, distorted towards the NE, SE, NW, and SW corners of the map
        <p></p>
        Distance: looks distorted towards the SE, NE, SW, NW corners.
        <p></p> 
        Direction: presumably preserves because it is a modified azimuthal projection </h3>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator</h2>
    <h3>Shape: preserves shape completely.
        <p></p>
        Area: preserves for the most part, heavily distorts to be greater along the poles.
        <p></p>
        Distance: distance appears greater towards the poles.
        <p></p> 
        Direction: distorted? possibly because it is a rectangle. </h3>

    <h2>Winkel Sphere</h2>
    <h3>Shape: preserves along the equator and the prime meridian, distorts near the NE, SE, NW, SW corners of the map.
        <p></p>
        Area: preserves along the equator and the prime meridian, distorts near the poles.
        <p></p>
        Distance: I think distance is preserved, but not sure.

    <h3>Shape: preserves for the most part, heavily distorted along the poles.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>Shape: distortion increases as we move away from the North Pole.
        <p></p>
        Area: distortion increases as we move away from the North Pole.
        <p></p>
        Distance: presumably preserved because it is an equidistant projection.
        <p></p> 
        Direction: not distorted? because it is a circle? not sure. </h3>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>Shape: distortion increases as we move away from the North Pole.
        <p></p>
        Area: distortion increases as we move away from the North Pole; more distorted than the World Equidistant Conic.
        <p></p>
        Distance: presumably preserved because it is an azimuthal projection.
        <p></p> 
        Direction: presumably preserved because it is an equidistant projection. </h3>

    <h2>Peirce Quincuncial North Pole Diamond</h2>
    <h3>Shape: completely preserved.
        <p></p>
        Area: preserved for the most part, some areas where size is increased.
        <p></p>
        Distance: I think it is distorted but I'm not sure.
        <p></p> 
        Direction: uncertain. </h3>

    <h3>Shape: preserved along the equator and the prime meridian, distortion increases in NE, SE, NW, SW corners.
        <p></p>
        Area: preserved for the most part, distortion increases towards the poles.
        <p></p>
        Distance: appears preserved, uncertain.
