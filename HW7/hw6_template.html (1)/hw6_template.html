<h1>Homework 7: Make a Proportional Symbol Map </h1>
<h2>Stephanie Hall</h2>
<h3>The symbols on this map represent where superfund sites are in NC counties, and the size of the symbol is proportional to that site's risk of exposure to environmental hazards that would exacerbate the superfund. I chose this topic because I am studying superfunds in another class, and this data set interested me because it shows how environmental hazards like fires, hurricanes, droughts, etc. can make an already hazardous and toxic site worse. I also was interested in seeing how close we are to these sites and how vulnerable they are to environmental hazards.</h3>
